What is eureka server (discovery server)
-----------------------------------------

In a Spring Boot microservice architecture, services need a way to find and communicate with each other. This is where Eureka Server, also known as a Discovery Server, comes into play. Here's a simpler explanation of its role and what the Config and Eureka Server are:

What is a Discovery Server (Eureka Server)?
Imagine you have multiple microservices, like:

A User Service that handles user data.
A Product Service that manages products.
An Order Service for orders.

Now, instead of hardcoding their addresses (like user-service.com, product-service.com), microservices register themselves to the Eureka Server, which acts like a directory or phonebook for all services. Other services can then ask Eureka to find out where a specific service is, like:

Order Service: "Hey Eureka, where's the Product Service?"
Eureka: "It's here at product-service.com!"

This is especially useful because microservices can scale up or down, and their addresses may change. Eureka keeps track of all those changes dynamically.

Key Components in Eureka:

1. Eureka Server (Discovery Server):

The central directory where all microservices register themselves.
Other services can query it to find where a particular service is running.

2.Eureka Client:

Every microservice is a client that registers itself with the Eureka Server and asks for the addresses of other services when needed
